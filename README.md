# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this module challenge is to create an earthquake map with two different map style and earthquake overlay with marker size corrected to the magnitude of the earthquake. In the new version of mapview, adding the tectonic plate's location on the map will allow the users to see the earthquake data and the relation between the plate's location and the event of the earthquake.

The first screenshot shows the tatonic plate location on earth and the place where earthquakes occured.
